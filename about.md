I am Adrien Ball and I live in Paris, France.

My current focus is on building machine learning systems. I have a background in both applied mathematics and software engineering. My experience building ML-based applications progressively made me understand that having good computer science skills was a prerequisite in what I do, rather than a bonus.

I have always enjoyed gaining autonomy in my work and this drives me each day a bit closer to a full-stack profile, even though my main passion remains machine learning. My curiosity and eagerness to learn new stuff play an important role in the choices I make in my life.

I recently joined [Sonos](https://www.sonos.com/) as part of the [acquisition of snips.ai](https://investors.sonos.com/news-and-events/investor-news/latest-news/2019/Sonos-Announces-Acquisition-of-Snips/default.aspx) where I had been working so far.

### Things I love
Rust, Python, open source code, indie games, riddles, beautiful science, gifs

### Things I hate
Bad design, ads, sticky headers, generalization errors
